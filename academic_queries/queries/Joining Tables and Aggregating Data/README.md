## Multi-Database Query Practice

The file [`queries/Joining_and_Summarizing_Data.sql`](queries/Joining_and_Summarizing_Data.sql) contains query solutions to questions involving:

- `v_art` (art gallery) — artwork filtering, LEFT JOINs
- `magazine` — subscription, keyword search
- `employees` — HR data analysis, salaries, filtering
- `bike` — inventory, stock management
- Use of `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ROLLUP`, `FORMAT`, `LIKE`, and subqueries

These queries demonstrate intermediate-to-advanced SQL capabilities in real-world scenarios.
