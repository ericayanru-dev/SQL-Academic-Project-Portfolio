# University Database Project

This project simulates a university's academic system using MySQL. It includes full schema definition, sample data inserts, and advanced queries to solve real academic tasks such as:

- Instructor assignments
- Course enrollment tracking
- Student birthday and age calculations
- Teaching capacity reports
- Cross-join analysis of faculty, terms, sections, and credit load

## Files

- `ddl_university_schema.sql` – Complete database schema (tables, relationships, foreign keys)
- `data_inserts.sql` – Sample data for colleges, departments, students, courses, faculty, and enrollments
- `university_queries.sql` – 10 SQL problems solved using advanced querying (JOINs, filters, groupings, and calculations)

## SQL Skills Demonstrated

- Schema design and normalization
- Foreign key constraints
- ENUM types and composite keys
- JOIN operations across multiple entities
- Data formatting (`DATE_FORMAT`, `DATEDIFF`, `MOD`)
- Aggregation and grouping logic
